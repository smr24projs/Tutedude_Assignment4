# Tutedude_Assignment4
In the Task1 I had opened the file in read mode and fetched the data from the text file and printed the output. Also used exception handling using try-except block
In the Task2 I had opened the file in write mode to write the content and also append text that needs to be added , thereby printing the final content of the file.
